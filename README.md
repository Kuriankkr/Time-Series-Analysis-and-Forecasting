# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting

The following github repo consists of some of the notebooks that I have created that contain an introduction and followed on by the application of Neural networks in Time Series 
analysis and forecasting. I would be adding more notebooks to this section.

Note: The notebooks that I have created is an amalgamation of the courses that I have taken as well as my own understandings from the internet that I have added into the notebook.

The link to the notebook "Time Series Analysis and Forecasting - an introduction" is given below. It wasnot opening on github initially last I checked
