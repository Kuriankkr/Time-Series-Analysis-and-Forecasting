# Introduction to Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting

The following github repo consists of a notebook that contains an Introduction to Time Series 
analysis and forecasting. I would be adding more notebooks to this section. The Data that I have used for the creation of the notebook can be downloaded as well

**Note**: The notebooks that I have created is an amalgamation of the courses that I have taken as well as my own understandings from the internet that I have added into the notebook. It still has a long way to go but is a good starter
